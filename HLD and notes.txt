assignement notes:
below are some key points should be part of assignment but due to time and health issue not implemented same.

- we can use lazy loading for modular structure
- we can use guards to avoid routes to preview "About Me" and "Work", if user details are not present.
- interface
- please ignore linting standards as my editor has some issue with configuration
- styling can be improved 
- validations are POCs
- there are still some issues with business logic as ex. for work timeline, last value in list is not getting. which can be resolved if time permits.
